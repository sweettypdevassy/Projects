## Overview
The "Node Application Containerized with Docker and Jenkins Integration" project showcases the process of building and containerizing a Node.js application using Docker and automating its CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.   
The Jenkins pipeline is configured to trigger builds, create Docker images of the application, push them to Docker Hub, and send email notifications with the build results. This integration ensures a streamlined workflow for continuous integration and deployment, enhancing efficiency and reliability in the development process.  

  

## Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Jenkins
- Git

## Project Workflow
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the Docker image.
3. Run the application in a Docker container.
4. Set up a Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD.
5. Automate Docker image builds and pushes to DockerHub.
